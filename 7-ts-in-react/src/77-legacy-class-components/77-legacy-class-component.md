# 7.7 Legacy class component

## Task:

Apply appropriate typing to the entire project.
Pay attention to the [MemorableQuotes](./components/MemorableQuotes.tsx) class component. 
It must remain class component. Add appropriate types to handle its `props` and `state`.


Get rid of all `:any` and `@ts-ignore` entries in your code.
