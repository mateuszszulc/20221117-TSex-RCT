# 7.5 Context communication

## Task:

Use the context for communication in our application: [UserContext](./context/UserContext.tsx).

So that the name of the logged in `User` is stored in it. Make up that name (some _stub_), activate the `Login` and `Logout` buttons, make them use context.

Establish valid data types inside the context.
