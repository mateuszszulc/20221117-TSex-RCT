You have an application in front of you that works in conjunction with the fake, 
but still network "back-end API". It is written in `JavaScript`.

1. Install this project
2. To run the back-end:
    ```shell
    npm run backend
    ```
3. Starting the front:
    ```shell
    npm run start
    # or simply:
    npm start
    ```
4. Use the documentation: [adding-typescript](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript/) to introduce `TypeScript` to your project step by step!
5. Details in the task: [53-react-cra-project](../5-migrate-to-ts/53-react-cra-project/REAME.md)
